I think
I found the greatest love
From high above me
She stood by me
when all was gone
And the world was
so unrelenting
When they tied my hands
with velvet string
They said I was worthless
but worth everything
And the one who hurt me,
he called on the phone
Deep in the night he said,
"Are you alone?"
I need you
because you are a woman
And I'll hate you
because you are a woman
And I'll love you
because you are a woman
On a brighter day
at the end of September
I'm finally stronger
without them
Don't let them take back
the things that you need
You're what I want,
not material things
They tie your hands
with velvet string
They say that you're worthless
but worth everything
And the one who hurt me,
he called on the phone
Deep in the night he said,
"Are you alone?"
I need you
because you are a woman
And I'll hate you
because you are a woman
And I'll love you
because you are a woman
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I think I've found
the greatest love
I think I've found
the greatest love
I think I've found
the greatest love
I think I've found
the greatest love
I think I've found, baby
I think I've found
the greatest love
Sent from high above, baby
I think I've found
the greatest love
